Lempel-Zev-Welch Compression
=============================
This project uses Lempel-Zev-Welch compression algorithm to compress a file and uncompress compressed file.

For large text files, I achieved a compression ratio of about 50%

In the folder named examples, there are examples of files which are compressed and uncompressed.

filename.txt is original file

filename.txt.lz is compressed file

uncompressed_filename.txt is this lz archive uncompressed
